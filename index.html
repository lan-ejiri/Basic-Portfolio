    <p>I am an aspiring fullstack web developer. I have a Bachelors Degree in Industrial Engineering, and am currently working toward a fullstack web development certificate from Rutgers Coding Bootcamp.</p>
   <br>
    <p>Unable to land a job in a completely relevant field as my major, I picked up a job as a Draftsman at a small woodwoorking tool manufacturing company. I gained many valuable work experiences from working there for a year and a half, such at learning how to get along with coworkers and getting used to demanding work flow. However, this was not what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I hoped that with my background in engineering, learning to code would help me land a better job.</p>
    <br>
    <p>My experiences before this drafting job includes mostly different types of tutoring. I have done 1-on-1 sessions with college peers for classes I took in previous semesters. I have worked for giant corporations such as C2 education in a 3-on-1 setting helping high schoolers get stellar SAT/ACT math scores to get into their dream college. I have done private tutoring for Japanese families to help their children be better adjusted for when they start school in the fall. These experiences really forced me to learn how to handle many different types of people, and I believe I am a more well-rounded person because of these opportunities. </p>
    <br>
<p>Upon completing this program, I would like to earn a job in the tech field for a large company, but I suspect I may have to freelance for a while to build up a formidable portfolio.</p>
